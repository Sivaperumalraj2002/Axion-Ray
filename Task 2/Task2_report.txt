Task 2 - Column Analysis and Cleaning Summary
Dataset shape: (100, 55)

Top critical columns (selected): KM, TOTALCOST, CAUSAL_PART_NM, REPAIR_DATE, REPAIR_AGE

Cleaning steps applied (summary):
- Standardized string columns by trimming whitespace. Lowercased selected categorical columns (STATE, BUILD_COUNTRY, PLATFORM, BODY_STYLE, PLANT).
- Filled categorical missing values with mode where missingness <= 5% of rows.
- Filled numeric missing values with median where missingness <= 5% of rows.
- Flagged outliers in KM and TOTALCOST using IQR rule and added boolean columns indicating outliers.
- Generated tags from CAUSAL_PART_NM, CORRECTION_VERBATIM and CUSTOMER_VERBATIM by tokenizing and selecting top keywords per row.

Top generated tags (sample): [('steering', 98), ('wheel', 97), ('strg', 95), ('asm', 89), ('black', 62), ('states', 56), ('jet', 27), ('heated', 11), ('coming', 10), ('whl', 10), ('found', 5), ('removed', 5), ('pra', 3), ('horn', 3), ('check', 3), ('cover', 3), ('sop', 3), ('module', 3), ('concern', 2), ('off', 2)]

Actionable insights (food for thought):
- High KM vehicles with higher TOTALCOST may indicate aging fleet cost trends; consider targeted preventive maintenance for high-mileage vehicles.
- Frequent causal parts (see viz_top_causal_parts) can inform spare-parts stock planning and supplier quality audits.
- Common tags found in customer and correction verbatims (e.g., steering, wheel, strg, asm, black) can be used to build a small taxonomy for automated routing of repairs.
- Outlier repairs (flagged) should be reviewed manually to check for billing errors or special incidents.
